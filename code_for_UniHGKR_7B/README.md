```shell
general_ins = "Given a question, retrieve relevant evidence that can answer the question from all knowledge sources: "
single_source_inst = "Given a question, retrieve relevant evidence that can answer the question from {} sources: "

general_ins_with_domain = "Given a {} domain question, retrieve relevant evidence that can answer the question from all knowledge sources: "
single_source_inst_domain = "Given a {} domain question, retrieve relevant evidence that can answer the question from {} sources: "
```
